a) 5 (i messed up a few times)
b) the first commit
c) log shows the history while status shows the current staging area
d) untracked isn't coming into contact with git, unstaged are changes not flagged to commit
e) checkout is to switch between branches while reset gets rid of uncommited changes in a branch
f) it goes smoothly if no conflicts, otherwise you need to resolve them
